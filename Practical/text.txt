A story is a narrative that consists of a connected series of real or imagined events, 
told through spoken words, written text, images, or other forms of communication to 
entertain, educate, or preserve culture. Stories can be fictional or non-fictional, 
ranging from a short tale or anecdote to a more extended novel or account of history.
